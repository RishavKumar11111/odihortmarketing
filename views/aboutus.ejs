                                    <p>Integrated Pest management plays a pivotal role in agricultural production and increased productivity. Timely and proper pest management not only helps in multiplication of predators and parasites in the eco-system, but also saves the crops from many diseases and insect attack.</p>
                                    <p>Pest surveillance is an important tool towards timely and proper execution and harnessing of Integrated Pest Management. Moreover, by the use of pest surveillance technology, insects and diseases are identified and presence of predators and parasites are counted. As a result of which, pest and diseases are effectively managed through application of eco-friendly integrated pest management system. For quick dissemination of the farmer advisory system to the farmers, e-Pest Surveillance Programme is being implemented from the year 2010. Now, it is being felt that this advisory system is time consuming. Therefore, to make it more effective and farmers’ friendly, Mobile App initiative has been taken up.</p>
